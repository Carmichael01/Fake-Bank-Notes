# Fake-Bank-Notes
Use of K-Means in Python to identify fake bank notes

### The Objective:
The purpose of the experiment is to determine if Machine Learning (K-means) can be used to accurately identify if a bank note is real or fake.

### The Background:
The course persribed the following steps to understand and about a K-means Machine Learning model over a set of data taken from the digitisation of 1,372 bank notes, where some were real and others were fake.  The original data set was created by using a industrial didgital camera that codified 5 features assocaited with the bank notes.  These looked at certain attributes relating to size, skewnewss, colour etc and to determine if certian similarities in the foregeries could be used to cluster them as fake.  More detail about the inital experienment as well the data codified can be found by clicking on the openML link above.

### The Approach:
The following outlines the stepos involved in exploring the data, building and deploying the ML model
